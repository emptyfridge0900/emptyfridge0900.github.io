## Problem
We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API int guess(int num), which returns three possible results:

* -1: Your guess is higher than the number I picked (i.e. num > pick).
* 1: Your guess is lower than the number I picked (i.e. num < pick).
* 0: your guess is equal to the number I picked (i.e. num == pick).
Return the number that I picked.

**Example 1:**
> **Input:** n = 10, pick = 6
> **Output:** 6  

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** n = 1, pick = 1  
> **Output:** 1  

**Example 3:**
> **Input:** n = 2, pick = 1 
> **Output:** 1 

```C#
public class Solution : GuessGame{
    public int GuessNumber(int n){
        var low = 0;
        var high = n;
        var ret = 0;
        while(low<=high)
        {
            var g = low+(high-low)/2;
            if(guess(g)==0)
            {
                ret=g;
                break;
            }
            if(guess(g)==-1)
                high=g-1;
            else
                log=g+1;
        }
        return ret;
    }
}
```
