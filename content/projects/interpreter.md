[Monkey programming lanuage](https://github.com/emptyfridge0900/interpreter)  [ðŸ‘‰Try it out](https://emptyfridge0900.dev/interpreter)

About a month ago watched this [video](https://youtu.be/yeatOU5vVsA?t=631), and I wanted to learn about interpreter.

While implementing a chess game a few months ago, I realized that the level of game programming was too high for me to challenge myself, so I decided to start with building an interpreter that I could follow by reading a [book](https://interpreterbook.com/).

I'll probably spend my whole after work hours work on this project until April.
